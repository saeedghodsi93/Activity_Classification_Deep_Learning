# A Deep Learning Model for Activity Classification Using 3D Sensor Data

In this project, I've designed and implemented a joint CNN-LSTM model for human activity classification using large-scale 3D data (i.e. the "NTU RGB+D" dataset). The code for the classification model has been written in Python, however, Matlab has been chosen for the preprocessing of data due to it's superior performance in working with large datasets.
